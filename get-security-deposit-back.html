						<!-- Article Body -->
						<div class="article-body">
							<p class="lead">
								You cleaned. You patched the nail holes. You even scrubbed the
								oven like it personally offended you. Then the deposit deduction
								email arrives with vague line items like “deep cleaning” and
								“maintenance.”
							</p>

							<p>
								If this sounds familiar, it’s because most renters approach
								move-out like a cleaning project—when it’s actually an evidence
								project. The outcome often depends less on how clean the place
								is and more on how clearly you can prove its condition and
								communicate correctly afterward.
							</p>

							<h2 id="problem">The Real Problem Nobody Talks About</h2>

							<p>
								Move-out disputes aren’t decided by who’s “right.” They’re
								decided by who has organized, timestamped, easy-to-understand
								proof. Most renters have some proof—random photos, a couple
								videos, a few texts—but it’s rarely complete, comparable, or
								easy for someone else to review quickly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Landlords and property managers handle these situations
								constantly. They’re used to emotional messages. They’re not used
								to renters sending a clean, structured evidence package that
								makes deductions hard to justify.
							</p>

							<blockquote>
								<p>
									“Most deposit disputes aren’t about cleaning—they’re about
									documentation. If you can’t prove it, it didn’t happen.”
								</p>
								<cite>— A property manager, translated into plain English</cite>
							</blockquote>

							<h2 id="mistakes">5 Common Mistakes That Doom Your Deposit</h2>

							<p>
								These mistakes are insanely common, even among renters who
								genuinely leave the place in great condition. The good news:
								they’re all fixable with a simple system.
							</p>

							<h3>Mistake #1: Taking Photos Like a Tourist</h3>

							<p>
								A few wide shots won’t cut it. You need a shot list: inside
								appliances, under sinks, baseboards, inside closets,
								windowsills, floors from multiple angles—plus close-ups of
								anything that could be questioned later.
							</p>

							<div class="info-box warning">
								<h4>⚠️ Warning</h4>
								<p>
									If you miss “high-argument” areas (oven, fridge, bathroom
									grout, blinds, walls behind furniture), you’re basically
									donating money to Future You’s stress.
								</p>
							</div>

							<h3>Mistake #2: No Move-In Reference</h3>

							<p>
								If you don’t have move-in photos, you can still protect
								yourself—but you must document current condition extremely well
								and be careful about how you phrase disputes. Your goal is to
								show the unit’s condition clearly at the time you returned
								possession.
							</p>

							<h3>Mistake #3: No Date + Context</h3>

							<p>
								Photos without timestamps, or without context (which room? which
								wall?), are easy to dismiss. Your evidence should be
								self-explanatory to someone who wasn’t there.
							</p>

							<div
								class="image-placeholder medium"
								style="
									background-image: url('images/get-your-deposit-back/evidence-compare.png');
									background-size: cover;
									background-position: center;
								"
							></div>

							<h3>Mistake #4: Not Getting Written Confirmation</h3>

							<p>
								Verbal “looks good” doesn’t survive contact with accounting. You
								want a written note confirming key return date/time, forwarding
								address, and (if possible) that the unit appeared in good
								condition.
							</p>

							<h3>
								Mistake #5: Sending the Wrong Kind of Message After Deductions
							</h3>

							<p>
								Angry messages feel satisfying for 12 seconds and expensive for
								12 months. The winning approach is calm, specific,
								evidence-based, and focused on itemization, documentation, and
								clear requests.
							</p>

							<h2 id="failed-solutions">Why Popular Solutions Don't Work</h2>

							<p>
								Most “advice” focuses on cleaning harder or arguing louder.
								Neither addresses the real failure point: proof and process.
							</p>

							<h3>❌ "Just Clean More"</h3>
							<p>
								Extra cleaning helps, but it doesn’t fix the real problem:
								documentation. You can clean perfectly and still get charged if
								you can’t clearly document condition or respond correctly when
								deductions appear.
							</p>

							<h3>❌ "Threaten Legal Action Immediately"</h3>
							<p>
								This often escalates, shuts down cooperation, and slows
								everything down. Start by requesting itemization and supporting
								documentation, then respond with evidence and specific disputes.
							</p>
							<h3>❌ "Argue Every Line Item Emotionally"</h3>
							<p>
								Property managers deal in documentation. The fastest path is to
								communicate like a project manager, not a poet: clear asks,
								specific references, and attached proof.
							</p>

							<div class="info-box tip">
								<h4>💡 Pro Tip</h4>
								<p>
									The biggest deposit losses happen when your evidence is
									scattered. The easiest win is turning your photos, notes, and
									messages into a clean “case file” that’s easy to review.
								</p>
							</div>

							<h2 id="solution">The Professional Approach</h2>

							<p>
								Pros don’t “hope for fairness.” They create a paper trail that
								makes unfair deductions difficult. The system is simple: capture
								complete evidence, organize it, get key steps confirmed in
								writing, and communicate with scripts that request itemization
								and attach proof.
							</p>

							<p>
								This isn’t about being confrontational—it’s about being clear.
								When your documentation is complete and organized, disputes
								become a straightforward administrative task instead of a
								stressful back-and-forth.
							</p>

							<h3>The Foundation Principle</h3>

							<p>
								Evidence beats effort. Your goal isn’t to prove you tried—it’s
								to prove the unit’s condition at a specific time. When photos
								are labeled, dated, and complete, the conversation changes
								immediately.
							</p>

							<div
								class="image-placeholder medium"
								style="
									background-image: url('images/get-your-deposit-back/steps-stack.png');
									background-size: contain;
									background-position: center;
									background-repeat: no-repeat;
								"
							></div>

							<h3>The Timing Factor</h3>

							<p>
								The best time to gather proof is after your stuff is out and
								before you hand in keys—ideally in daylight. Not at midnight
								with 2% phone battery and pure optimism. Timing isn’t just
								convenience; it’s what makes evidence usable.
							</p>

							<h3>The Right Materials Match</h3>

							<p>
								This is less about “buying the perfect supplies” and more about
								using the right assets: a shot list, a folder naming system, and
								scripts that request itemization and documentation. These are
								the tools that actually move the needle.
